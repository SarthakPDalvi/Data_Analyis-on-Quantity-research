# Data_Analyis-on-Quantity-research
A combined project featuring a Gas Storage Valuation tool and a Machine Learning Loan Default Predictor. It analyzes natural gas pricing for storage profitability and uses Random Forest classification to estimate loan default risk.

This project includes two major components:

Gas Storage Valuation Model 

assigment2

 – A Python-based calculator that analyzes natural gas market prices, estimates storage costs, interpolates missing price data, and evaluates the profitability of different gas injection–withdrawal trading strategies.

Loan Default Prediction System 

loan

 – A machine-learning model using Random Forest to predict the probability of loan default and compute expected financial loss, with data preprocessing, scaling, and performance evaluation.
